        <div class="1stPara">
            Since my elementary school days, I have developed a deep passion for music that has shaped much of my life. 
            What began as a simple love for melodies and rhythms quickly evolved into a hobby that I cherish dearly. 
            I started singing at a young age, finding joy in expressing myself through music. 
            Over the years, this passion has only grown stronger, leading me to explore various genres and styles of singing.

            Today, I actively seek out opportunities to engage with my love for music. 
            participate in art clubs and choir works, where I can collaborate with fellow artists and hone my skills.
            Being part of these creative communities not only allows me to share my passion with others but also helps me grow as a performer and artist. 
            Through music, 
            <div class="last">I have found a powerful means of self-expression and connection with those around me,
            and I look forward to continuing this journey as I explore new artistic avenues.

            I have developed a passion for fashion design, a skill I inherited from my mother. 
            Her creativity and keen eye for style have inspired me to explore my own artistic vision in this field. 
            I enjoy experimenting with different fabrics, patterns, and designs, 
            and I aspire to express my unique identity through my creations. 
            Fashion, for me, is not just about clothing; itâ€™s a form of self-expression and a way to connect with others.
